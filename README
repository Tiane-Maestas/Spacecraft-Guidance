1. Description
    - This project builds the 'orbits' module that contains two main sub-modules
    named 'TwoBodyKeplerOrbit' and 'OrbitUtilities'. The 'TwoBodyKeplerOrbit' module
    is a representation of a classical keplerian orbit in the ECI coordinate frame. 
    It calculates, stores, and modifies all of the fundamental orbital elements such as 
    semi-major axis, eccentricty, ext... The 'OrbitUtilities' module is a static class 
    that contains many helper methods in building and getting information needed to construct
    and orbit. The general idea is to make measurements and use the utilities module to build
    an initial position and velocity needed to construct a preliminary orbit.

2. How to run?
    - This is a standard 'pipenv' structured project. If you don't have python and pip installed
    on your computer first start there. Then using pip, install 'pipenv'. Once installed and have 
    a terminal open to the directory of this project start the virtual enviornment using the 
    command: 'pipenv shell'. Then install all of the dependent packages using 'pipenv install'.
    From here the project is set up and you can run any of the files using normal python 'filename'.
    
    - To run the output of our core project run main.py. 'testing.py' is just documentation of all 
    of the important tests that were run on the orbits module.

3. About main.py
    - 'main.py' outlines how to go from 3 initial line of sight measurements on earth to a complete
    oribit. It also propogates the orbit to a desired julian date. For now, all of the configuration
    for this process is done by simply modifying the variables at the top of this file.
